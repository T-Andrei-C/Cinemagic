## Technologies Used:
- **React**: Used for building the application interface
- **Node.js**: Used for executing JavaScript code
- **Express**: Used for creating our own API
- **MongoDB**: Used to store our own models for the application
- **SCSS**: Used for styling the website

## Challanges

- The fetch on the Movie API didn’t work as we expected, so we selected the movies we wanted and created our own database with the help of the API information.

### Server: 
#### Install dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### .env file
Copy the .env.example as .env and fill up the environment variable for your personal mongodb connecttion url.

#### Running the code

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

It will start the server with nodemon. So it will watch the changes and restart the server if some ot the files changed.



### Client: 

#### Install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### Runnig the code

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

And the create-react-app react-scripts package will start your frontend on the 3000 port and you can visit the http://localhost:3000 on your preferred browser.
